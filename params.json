{"name":"INSAcity","tagline":"A 2D city simulator game, made using SDL & Pascal","body":"### Welcome to INSAcity !\r\nINSAcity is a **very** basic city simulation game, developped in Pascal, and using SDL for graphics.\r\n\r\nThe source code has been published here mainly to help students that have to do projects using Pascal, which isn't always the simplest thing to do, and to show that even with a language depicted as \"obsolete\" by many, people can make performant, functional and fun programs :). We hope you enjoy it !\r\n\r\n##Some INSAcity's features:\r\n*A resource system including money (taxes !), food, shelter, work & environment.\r\n*Buildings that has an impact on those resources\r\n*An RPG-like system with XP, LVLs, QUESTS; giving the mayor XP (and eventually a LVL UP) as he does great things like getting 42 citizens in his city.\r\n*A basic save system (the mayor's LVL and XP are saved in a file and loaded when starting a game with the same mayor's name)\r\n*Pollution/Population's density maps.\r\n\r\n##Some screenshots\r\n\r\n![Construction](http://img826.imageshack.us/img826/2994/capturedu20120625184417.png)\r\n![Buildings informations](http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/3844/capturedu20120625184802.png)\r\n![Pollution map](http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/7387/capturedu20120625184438.png)\r\n![Game summary](http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/3808/capturedu20120625184454.png)\r\n\r\n*Code by: Ahmed Kachkach & Jean-Marie Comets*","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
